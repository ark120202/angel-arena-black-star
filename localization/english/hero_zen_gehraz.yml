npc_arena_hero_zen_gehraz_hype: 'The insidious and elusive Xen is able to spoil the enemy''s plans with the help of his interrupted skills. And with the help of the Ultimate, he becomes incredibly mobile and can use all his abilities at the same time, without letting anyone down.'
npc_arena_hero_zen_gehraz_bio: 'Multidimensional essence Xena strives for knowledge, strives for cognition of being. At least, this task, he motivates his studies of the space-time continuum. In fact, everything is trivial: Zen seeks to outdo Stargeyzer. He was not always like that: once upon a time he was a creature from the race of Ish''Kafel (Dark Seer). He was an outstanding personality, and his native dimension became too close to him. Because Zen has developed a way to split his essence into several parts, to make it possible to exist in several dimensions at once. So he gained unprecedented power. Thanks to this, he could expand the scope of his studies and their speed, and also raise his combat potential. For many centuries he pursued Stargeizer, eager to learn the secret of his abilities. In this pursuit, he lost himself and finally disappeared in his copies. His desire to outdo Stargeyzer turned into an obsession, and he will not stop at anything to achieve his goals.'
