npc_arena_hero_sara_hype: 'Fragile Sarah becomes stronger with each killed creep, gaining energy for him. Weak at the beginning, it becomes stronger the longer the game lasts. In literate hands, no one can resist it.'
npc_arena_hero_sara_bio: 'Sarah was born in an unhappy family. She did not have a father, and her mother was a prostitute-alcoholic. The girl did not attend school, did not communicate with anyone other than a drunk mother and received a psychological trauma, became a sociopath. One day she killed her mother and family next door. After this slaughter, something awakened in her. She felt a strange and dark power in her. Later, she met someone who called herself the Priestess of the Void. He helped develop her abilities. Sarah was getting stronger every day, with every murder. Until her homeworld was empty. So she traveled the dimensions, leaving behind her ruins, fueling her forces with the murders and agonies of her victims. So she got to the arena of the Angels - the place where the strongest creatures of the Universe collapsed. Perhaps, at least there will be opponents with whom she can play a little longer ...'
