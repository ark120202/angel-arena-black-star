npc_arena_hero_sai_bio: 'The Mighty Warrior plowed a multitude of worlds in search of worthy opponents. Nobody knew where He came from and what He was capable of: those who wanted to fight with Him could not even scratch His skin, and He only had to move his sword a little to knock the enemy dead. In the worlds He did not stay long - after making sure of the weakness of the creatures, He walked further along his unknown path. It used to happen that the opponents could give Him a more or less worthy fight, but only until the Warrior received a deep wound - shedding his blood, an unknown force filled Him, and His punches grew all the stronger than the more serious wounds He received. And when the battle was over, the damage was delayed, as if they were not there. But one day a stranger happened to encounter Kadash. He challenged him, and a bloody battle began. Never before had he had to fight with such an enemy - his blade, reaching the goal, could not injure the thick armor of the Immortal Horseman. Again and again the Warrior took strikes, and became stronger and stronger. Sometimes he himself waved his sword to experience more pain, but still he did not have the strength to repel Kadash is pressure. No one was inferior. And now, it seemed, the end - His body was covered with horrific wounds, it seemed incompatible with life. ''It was a worthy duel ... I''ve never met such an artful enemy ...'' croaked the Warrior, leaning on the blade. «You will be the second one to whom I will show my true face ...» The warrior struck himself with the sword to the very heart, and some awesome power tore him from the inside - before Kadash appeared a fiery, demonic monster, exuding huge waves of strength and destruction. With one wave of his hand, he killed the Immortal Horseman, then it was decayed ... Kadash did not perish, but paid tribute to his powerful rival, after continuing his journey. The warrior also did not die definitively - it took many years for Him to restore his body from the dust. Restoring the body, He found a new goal of his journey - again to find the rider, and again to challenge him. This path led him to the arena of the Angels, where besides Kadash the strongest warriors from all over the Universe gathered. This match promised him a glorious victory, or a glorious death.'
