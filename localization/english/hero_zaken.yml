npc_arena_hero_zaken_bio: |-
  Zaken is the legendary king of pirates. From the very childhood of his parents, soldiers were killed. The boy miraculously survived and lived in the slums of one of the many port cities. He had an innate talent - he could pick up objects and manipulate them. Zaken always dreamed of sea voyages, watching merchant ships in the port. But one day a ship appeared, sharply different from all previously seen by the boy. The wind waved black torn sails, and the flag bore the image of a human skull. The ship opened fire on the wharf, shattering coastal taverns and benches. People fled in panic, leaving all their good. When the wharf was empty, the ship entered the bay, and pirates descended from its side, collecting all the valuables abandoned by the merchants.
  Miraculously survived Zaken with admiration watched the sea brigands. To get on the ship, he climbed into a large box full of furs. The pirates seized Zaken with the box and left.
  Soon Zaken was found. The boy was not thrown overboard and given a chance to show himself. For many years he roamed the sea on the ship "Dead Dream". Like every boy, he began with the drayaniya of decks, but, having shown himself in battle, he earned the respect of the team and the captain. His telekinetic abilities allowed him to masterfully master immediately with seven swords. At a young age, no one could cope with his art on an equal footing, in a fair fight. Soon he was promoted to the boatswain and became the captain's right hand, but this was not enough for the young man. He wanted his ship. But one day, over all piracy, the threat of extinction looms. A large trading company, by investing huge amounts of money, built a huge military fleet to end robbery once and for all. And then seven kings of pirates gathered in the secret bay of the Dark Leviathan to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to collect their fleet and give battle to the trading company. This fight would decide who will rule the seas. And two fleets clashed in the Caribbean. The ships went to the bottom one after another, and it was clear that the defeat of the trading company was inevitable. But the sea opened, and a huge something, covered in green skin, overturned the entire fleet of pirates. "Leviathan!" Shouted the sailors. Huge tentacles dragged the ships to the bottom. Few ships managed to survive. Among them was the ship Zaken. The captain was killed during the battle, so Zaken took his place. No one disputed this, because the sailors understood that it was pointless to fight with him. He showed himself to be an excellent commander. Collecting the remains of pirates scattered throughout the world, he proclaimed himself the last King of pirates and vowed to end the company.
